Imagine a grid of 10k by 10k cell, each cell 100 nm square, the total area would be 1 square mm with 100 million cell. Each cell will be a weight parameter of the network, its should be made with a materials who have smi permanent property which is an increasing conductivity with more current applied to it, and a default state of decay toward less conductivity. Two or maybe all fours of the side quadrant will contain activation unit. The activation unit contain a leaky capacitor, if the capacitor reach a treshold voltage, it will be discharged(activated), thus further increasing the current that goes trough the active weight.
