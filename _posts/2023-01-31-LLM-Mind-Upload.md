With current level of technology, LLM probably already able to emulate part of human brain. With the combination of sequential speech, motor movement, eyesight, and even body hormonal change data, a sequence prediction model probably can emulate some part of human brain. Current LLM already show many emergent properties. Emergent property that is crucial to human cognition, things such as thinking and emotion could emerge if the right combination of sequence data are fed to current GPT like architecture.

Unless technology build an atomically precise, or close to it scanner to map the structure of human brain it will be impossible to recreate a human mind in an artificial substrate. Just like current neuromorphic chip have a hard time implementing a network thats trained in the digital realm, in the analog world many non obvious emergent behavior will play to an advantage or disadvantage. I predict a future neuromorphic neural network system will be deeply coupled with its substrate, meaning the best performing architecture will be trained an run in its own hardware, and we will have a hard time copying or moving it into another substrate.
