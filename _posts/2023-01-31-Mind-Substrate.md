Number of neuron : Around 86 billion, mostly, about 69 billion in cerebellum, the rest 15 billion in cerebral cortex and 4-6 billion in visual cortex. the 15 billion in cerebral cortex contains 65 trillion connection. So at the limit human main cognition are contained within 65 trillion analog connection between neurons.

## How Transformer Network Encode Information

How GPT like transformer network encode information greatly will inform our understanding on how it takes to build a digital mind. 

Book <   > Equation

On one extreme, a book or conventional computer code encode its information literally by spelling its content in sequential manner. This method of information storage must be read in an order, it needs large number of bits to store. To express those in formation one just have to read it or in case of computer program execute its machine code in 1:1 basis (the processor execute machine code nothing more nad nothing less). 
The other extreme, something like an equation is the most dense form of information. Several bits of equation can be expressed into very intricate complex form, although an equation needs more complex machine to express it.

An interesting experiment would be how a neural connection network system encode something like mandelbrot set. A mandelbrot set can be tough as a standalone universe in itself, infinite and non repeating features. Imagine forcing neural network to memorize mandelbrot set, the network is tasked to predict the next visual shape of mandelbrot set under subsequent magnification. here is some hypothesis:
1. start from a small network, it will try to memorize with an almost 1:1 relation between its connection parameter and the visual shape of MD set. The network probably can generalize small part of the pattern, but it must not be exposed to too much data, as it has limited capacity for generalization and memorization.
2. As one increase the size of the network,
