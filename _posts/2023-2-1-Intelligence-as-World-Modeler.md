<!-- ## Intelligence as World Modeler -->

I am reminded by what was said by George Holtz that intelligence is information compression, which probably started by Douglas Hofstadler in Godel Escher Bach. Thinking deeper i conclude that intelligence is not exactly a form of compression, because if it is then the most optimized version would be physics because that contains the most compressed version of how the world works, thus everything nescesary to operate in our universe can be calculated from it, which comes our next dilemma, the calculation part. One needs almost infinite amount of compute to deduce practical things from the underlying physics, thus I propose another thing; Intelligence is an attempt to balance between compression and computation. The most optimized form of intelligence would be the one who can contain (or memorize) the most variety of compressed algoritm, such as physics or mandelbrot equation and backing it up with nescesary computational capacity to compute it, thus deducing its prediction, such as the world or mandelbrot graphics.
